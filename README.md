This project presents an *Exploratory Data Analysis of Lung Cancer Dataset**. This study provides evidence of some common misconceptions about the leading causes of lung cancer.
Smoking and chest pain are not the primary factors contributing to lung cancer. Instead, the findings
emphasize the significance of other variables such as allergies and alcohol consumption in determining an
individual’s risk of developing lung cancer.

Here is the link of [RShinyDashboard](https://mkreman.shinyapps.io/lung_cancer_shinyapp/) and the link of [youtube video](https://youtu.be/voQh1KgLVCQ) explaining the dashboard.

The dataset is collected from the site [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer) and published in consequence of the study, “Dritsas, Elias, and Maria Trigka. 2022.”Lung Cancer Risk Prediction with Machine Learning Models” Big Data and Cognitive Computing 6, no. 4: 139. https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc6040139“.
